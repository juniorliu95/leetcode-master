Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

 

Example 1:
'''
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Example 2:
'''
'''
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
'''

Constraints:

`0 <= x <= 231 - 1`


# 思路
这里的重点是有可能找不到平凡根,所以要在mid前后都看一看,是不是已经到了return的时候

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        
        head, tail = 0, x+1
        
        while head<=tail:
            mid = (head+tail) // 2
            
            square = mid*mid
            
            if square == x:
                return mid
            elif mid*mid < x:
                head = mid + 1
                if head*head > x:
                    return mid
            else:
                tail = mid - 1
                if tail*tail < x:
                    return tail
        
        return mid
```
